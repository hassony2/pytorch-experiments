# Pytorch experiments

Some simple experiments with pytorch in the form of jupyter notebooks

[facesExample.ipynb](facesExample.ipynb) is a simple example where we train a neural network on a small dataset (37 pairs of images).
From one view we try to predict another.

To achieve that, we use very basic full connected neural networks.
